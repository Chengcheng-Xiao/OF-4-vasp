# OF-4-vasp
Geometry Optimisation and Quadratic fit program for VASP

This program was written with Python
This program can do:
  1.Check POSCAR symmetry (Determin wether lattice paremeters are the same).
  2.Change lattice parameters and creat correspond POSCAR by your favor.
  3.Submit Geometry optmization job.
  4.After calculation complete, check for convergence and out put "data.dat" contianing energy data and lattice parameters.
  5.Fit lattice parameters and print the optmized one (experiemental)
  
I'm new to github, as well as coding, this is just a test project.
