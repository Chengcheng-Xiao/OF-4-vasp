# OF-4-vasp
Geometry Optimisation and Quadratic fit program for VASP

This is a program written in python.
It can:
  1. Determie wether your structure have same lattice paramteres(ie. a=b=c).
  2. Change lattice parameters by your choice and produce correspond POSCAR file. 
  3. Keep your lattice symmetry un-changed.
  4. Submit all jobs (If you like).
  5. Analysis calculated data and try to fit them through a Quadratic function inorder to find the local(global) minimum.

This progrm is a raw experiement. I'm new in coding.
