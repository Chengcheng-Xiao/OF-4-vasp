# OF-4-vasp
Geometry Optimisation and Quadratic fit program for VASP

This program was written with Python

This program can do:

    1.Check POSCAR "symmetry" (Actually only determins wether lattice paremeters are the same).
    2.Change lattice parameters and creat correspond POSCAR.
    3.Submit Geometry optmization job.
    4.After calculation complete, check for convergence and out put "data.dat" contianing energy data and lattice parameters.
    5.Fit lattice parameters and print the optmized one (not done)
